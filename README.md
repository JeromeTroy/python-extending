Following tutorial for extending Python with C

## Some directions
After building the extension module c code, 
we need to compile it and link it to python.

In this case this is done via 
section 1.5 on https://docs.python.org/3/extending/extending.html
however this claims it rebuilds the interpreter for the specific 
project.  Instead we can use details provided
https://docs.python.org/3/extending/building.html#building
for "dynamic learning"
